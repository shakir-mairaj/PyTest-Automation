# PyTest Automation
Pytest is a testing framework for Python. It provides a simple way to write and execute tests for your code, including unit tests, functional tests, and integration tests. Pytest makes it easy to discover and run tests, as well as to write tests in a readable and maintainable way. Pytest supports fixtures, which are reusable objects that can be used to set up test data, and it also provides a rich set of built-in assert functions to test the behavior of your code. Additionally, Pytest has a plugin system that enables users to extend its functionality with custom functionality.

Here are some of the most commonly used pytest commands:

    pytest - runs all tests in the current directory and subdirectories
    pytest <file_name> - runs all tests in the specified file
    pytest <file_name>::<function_name> - runs a specific test function in the specified file
    pytest -k <expression> - runs tests whose name matches the given expression
    pytest -m <marker_expression> - runs tests marked with the specified marker
    pytest -x - stop after first failure
    pytest -v - verbose output
    pytest --tb=<style> - specify traceback style (e.g. "long" or "short")
    pytest --junitxml=<file_name> - output test results to a JUnit XML file
    pytest --cov=<module_name> - run tests with coverage analysis for the specified module
    pytest filename --html=htmlfilename.html
